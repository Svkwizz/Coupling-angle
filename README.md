coding for coordination pattern
This is MATLAB code for calculating coordination pattern between two adjacent joints based on vector coding analysis, using positions of X,Y,Z coordinates of those segments to be analysed.
[ x y z] - 1st segment initial position, coordinate values should be putted accordingly
[ x1 y1 z1] 1st segment final position, coordinate values should be putted accordingly
[ x| y| z|] 2nd segment initial position, values should be putted accordingly
[ x1| y1| z1| ] 2nd segment final position,coordinate values should be putted accordingly
